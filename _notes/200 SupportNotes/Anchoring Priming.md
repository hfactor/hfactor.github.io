title: Anchoring Priming

If you are asked to guess (not calculate) the result of 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, you might guess a higher number compared to your guess of the result for 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8. 

This priming happens because of **anchoring** to the first number (1 versus 8), as you have an initial exposure to a number, and you are anchored to that number, which influences the subsequent judgment.
