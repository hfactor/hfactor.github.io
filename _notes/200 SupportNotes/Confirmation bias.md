- Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's prior beliefs or values.
- People display this bias when they select the information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information, or when they interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing attitudes. 
- Due to [[What you see is all there is]], people will be quick to seize on limited evidence that confirms their existing perspective while ignoring seeking proof that is contrary.

- [[Lots of inputs and a strong filter]]
