As users spend most of their time on **other sites**, they prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. By using existing patterns and mental models, we can create superior user experiences where the users can focus on their tasks rather than on learning the pattern. When making changes, minimize discord by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited time. *Reduce learning curve, bring familiarity.*
