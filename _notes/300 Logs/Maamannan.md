Yet another brilliant movie from Mari Selvaraj. Unlike his previous film, [[Pariyerum Perumal]] this movie has fewer symbols and a more thriller narration, with clear politics. Mari doesn't hide his political stance; it's evident in every aspect, from character names to occupations. The use of black and white shots in the movie was also interesting.

Mamannan's role played by Vadivelu was a masterclass in acting! His actions, expressions, and singing were the soul of the movie. Fahad also did a great job, blending well with the setting. However, Keerthy's role seemed less significant.

I personally liked Udhayanidhi Stalin's portrayal. Though his performance was average, it was refreshing to see a politician (MLA, Minister, and Son-of-CM) in a caste-politics themed movie.
