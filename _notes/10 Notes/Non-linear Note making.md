Normal notes are linear, mainly focused on subjects, categorys, and subcategorys. It's a good way if the intention is to collect data. But [[Normal note-taking fails to connect ideas]]

Non-linear systems offer a better way for building knowledge. Visual note-taking, [[Zettelkasten]], etc. are the best examples of it. It's more about [[Writing the way you think]].
