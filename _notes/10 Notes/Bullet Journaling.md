Ryder Carroll created a method of organising personal information such as tasks, reminders, to-do lists, notes in a single notebook called Bullet Journal.  It was primarily created for analog notebooks, while there are digital bullet journal users too.

### Concepts 
- Any notebook can be turned into a bullet journal. You can build layouts and improve over time. 
- You can keep it decorative or minimal. **I keep it rough.**
- It recommends rapid logging, short bullet notes. Also, the different types of bullets are used as differentiator of content type and status. 
- Index page is a Topic linked to multiple pages (while traditional notebooks links page to category) 
- [[How I use Bullet Journal]]
