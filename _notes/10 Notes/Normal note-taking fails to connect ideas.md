In standard note-taking methods, we sort by categorys and sub-categorys, building a hierarchical tree structure of knowledge. The information is sorted and has a "flow," but chances of connecting two different ideas are rare. Intention of notes is not just to remind you of what you learned. Spaced Repetition or revision is not the only job of notes. *The note should work as a place to inspire, surprise you while brainstorming.*
