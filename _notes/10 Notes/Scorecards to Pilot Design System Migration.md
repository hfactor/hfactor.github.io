Start building a design system by building a weighted Interface Inventory, based on frequency of reuse of common components. Then start with a pilot project. Use Pareto Principle.

### Sweet Spot
- Potential for reusable components/patterns. 
- Components with High-Business value. 
- How easy it is to build them. Time frame
- Inspire someone, make them design system evangelist
- Marketing potential. 
- Can be decoupled and built/don't break.
- Create a Pilot Scorecard (1-10) that shows you which products have a better score, based on these sweet spots.
