Instead of building wireframes using tools like Balsamiq, this method suggests taking screenshots and marking those specific changes with [[Fat-marker method]]. You can use an iPad or screenwriters, or even using tools like PowerPoint / MS Paint is enough.  The idea is to 'inform,' but without spending too much effort or time. 

*Eg: Adding a `>` symbol next to an existing table, and marking `search` on the left and `filter` on the right side of the table, between Table and Title is clearer than a 100-word document.*
