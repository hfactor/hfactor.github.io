Users focus on their needs. They have goals and objectives. And that's their perspective. They are not worried about the product you are building. It is a common thing that users will ask for features, that product should include. In such cases, we need to ask the right questions, and pivot the conversation from "specific feature" to "pain point.

We need to understand the problem, the value of pain, and how to solve it. It allows us to explore multiple solutions and choose a better one with a broader vision.
