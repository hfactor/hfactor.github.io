Similar to how I [[Documenting Meetings]], I use a simple Change log within Figma (Read: [[Changelog as a consistent communication tool]]) to track the design evolution from a design perspective. This log consists of a small component with a title (for version number and date) and a text-field (for bullet notes). The primary focus of this log is not on design changes or designers' efforts but rather on tracking common decisions and understanding shifts. (Read: [[Focus on Outcome, not Output]])

We follow a two-number version system like XX.YY, where YY increments for any changes in design systems or minor tweaks (aligned with the concept of Ship and Show in [[Ship-Show-Ask]]). The XX part changes only when it's based on a decision we took (not necessarily a fork, but may involve significant changes from developers).
