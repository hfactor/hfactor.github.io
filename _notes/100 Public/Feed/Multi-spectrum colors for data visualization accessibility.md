- Monotone has its own aesthetic appeal. 
- But there is a higher chance that it fails on accessibility due to color blindness. 
- While choosing colors for data visualizations, pick colors across the spectrum. 
- Different hues, tints, and tones. This makes it more accessible for color-blind people. T
- hey might not see all colors, but there will be a sense of differentiation between shades.
