- [[Lean UX]] follows a build > test > iterate loop, while [[Design Sprints]] follows unpack > ideate > evaluate > test > refine loop. 
- Design Sprint is more about evaluation, while lean UX is about evolution.
- There is a problem with lean UX that users are not very forgiving. Not all businesses can attempt Lean UX, as it's hard to gain back the trust once it's lost. 
- Design sprint provides a user-validated draft, which provides better clarity on the backlog for design and development.
