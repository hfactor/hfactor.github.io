- While Wireframing using pen and paper is an interesting way of communication that helps in building clarity over the idea – it is time-consuming for non-designers. 
- Especially when non-designer manager uses it as a tool to communicate with designers. 
	- *Also, wireframe is 'instructive' than suggestive.*
- Tools like Balsamiq work very similar to Figma or Sketch, but with some restrictions. 
- The time a non-designer takes to build is quite high. 
- To bring clarity over feature and edge-cases, it is better to use [[Breadboarding]]. 
- By using [[Breadboarding over Wireframes]], there is a significant time saving, and it also provides designers more ground to think and solve design from a visual perspective.
