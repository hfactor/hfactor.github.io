In standard note-taking methods, we sort by topics and sub-topics, building a hierarchical tree structure of knowledge. The information is sorted and has a "flow," but chances of connecting two different ideas are rare. Intention of notes is not just to remind you of what you learned. [[Spaced Repetition]] or revision is not the only job of notes. *The note should work as a place to inspire, surprise you while brainstorming.*
