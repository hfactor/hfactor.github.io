## Definition 
- Design System is a collection of reusable [[Components]], build using [[Atomicity]] and Sub-atomic [[Design Tokens]] particles that follow the guideline, behave consistently, and together work as the building block of the product.
- A design system is not a pattern library or a sticker sheet. Atoms being consistent or similar in a design system won't make the final result compatible. For that, it requires a clear documented guideline on behavior and usage patterns. Usage patterns, organisms, and templates make the system scalable [[Design is Scaling]]. 
- It follows [[Lego-like structure]] but does come with some themes and rules. *The combinations are not unlimited.*
- Consider the design system as the single source of truth that groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product.
- Start with [[Scorecards to Pilot Design System Migration]] instead of over planning and underachieving.
- [[Design System Learning]]
