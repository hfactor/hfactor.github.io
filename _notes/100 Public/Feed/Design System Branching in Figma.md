We, at Kaleyra Designs, currently follow [[Ship-Show-Ask]] format for Design System Branching. We keep [[Decision Documentation for Communication]], and use [[Changelog as a consistent communication tool]]. 

For **Ship**, designer directly merge it to design system, and take care of feedbacks. If it's more complicated, the change will be added (and **show**) as a variant, and will clean up as we have more clarity. If the sophistication and impacts are high, we save it a s a new component, and discuss it in our bi-weekly '**Ask**' meetings.
