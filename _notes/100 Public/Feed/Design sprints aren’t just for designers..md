- [[Design Sprints]] is a problem-solving process that provides validation to the solutions. The focus is on identifying and understand the problems and developing solutions, and not design.
- **Here, design is just the medium of communication.** 
- The result will be successful when cross-functional teams work together to uncover and test a problem or set of problems.
