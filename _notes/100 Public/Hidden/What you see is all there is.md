*What you see is all there is* (WYSIATI) is a phenomenon of how people jump to conclusions based on limited information. They tend to focus on existing evidence and ignore absent evidence. 

As a result, System 1 offers believable stories based on limited evidence. These impressions or intuitions can then be endorsed by System 2 and turn into deep-rooted values and *beliefs*. (LOL!)
