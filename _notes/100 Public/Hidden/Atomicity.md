- Atomicity refers to the smallest, irreducible building block material. 
- The core concept is that as you build things after defining the smallest, individual elements, then the possibility of mixing and matching increases, thus improving the scope of building [[Lego-like structure]]
- It is seen in [[Implimenting a design System]], as we start by building atoms -- the smallest, building block materials, or in [[Zettelkasten]], which recommends writing 'atomic' note that contains a single concept.
