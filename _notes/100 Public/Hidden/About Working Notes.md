Working notes contains a collection of notes I have written over time, as a process to accumulate knowledge. These are my Second-brain / digital garden. The notes follow concepts from [[Zettelkasten]] method and Andy's [[Evergreen Notes]] - to be atomic, linked, and concept-oriented.

Earlier, I used to make transactional notes but understood that those [[Normal note taking fails to connect ideas]]. Also, currently, I use note-taking as a tool for thinking. [[Better Thinking over Better Note-taking]].

As I am the primary consumer of these notes, the notes might contain half-baked, WIP stuff that might not make sense for you! Also, the notes contain texts in [Malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam), my native language, and links to private notes.
