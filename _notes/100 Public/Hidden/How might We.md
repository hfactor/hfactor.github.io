title: How might We
tag: Design

*How might We*, is a framework pattern for Decision building workshops which recommends rephrasing problems to opportunities before finding the solution. 

Once the problem is clear and specific, without focusing on the solution, convert the problem statement to a sentence that starts with *"How might we..".* This provides more clarity on the problem, the opportunity.
