#### Understand
- What is the problem we’re trying to solve? 
- [[Is this a real problem]]? 
- Who is this problem relevant / why do they care to have it solved? 
 
#### Diverge
- What are the hypothetical solutions might exist to solve these problems?
- What are all the creative ways we could approach this problem?
- What are the boundaries that are either constraining us or helping us find a solution? 

#### Converge
-  Which of our ideas might work best to test our hypothesis?
-  How can we select good solutions without being biased or presumptive? 
 
#### Prototype
- What will we need to build to run an experiment?
-  How will we conduct this experiment to get the answers we need? 

#### Test
- Who will be the best people to experiment with? 
- How will we find them and include them in our tests without influencing their choices or feedback?
