I agree to Jason Fried's [perspective](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/669-why-enterprise-software-sucks) (written in 2007) on why Enterprise Software Experiences is bad. It's primarily because **The Buyers Aren’t the Users**.

> The experience takes a back seat to the feature list, future promises, and buzz words.

In such cases, what we get as product feedbacks, are not the feedbacks, but expectation, and they are highly biased to the promises, market trend and so on.
