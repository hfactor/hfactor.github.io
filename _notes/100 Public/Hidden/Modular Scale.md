- Typography combinations demand a scale while documenting the usage pattern. 
- A modular scale is a concept in which the sequence of such numbers relates to one another meaningfully, mainly with a standard multiplier. 
- This helps to create a proportion, which helps in building visual hierarchy. 
> *A modular scale, like a musical scale, is a prearranged set of harmonious proportions.
