I've been privillaged to access to computers and the internet since the days of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rediff.com">Rediffmail's</a> free email service. As I entered college, the internet became a part of my life, and I found my first online homes on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)">Blogspot</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>. In 2008, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/anivar">Anivar Aravind</a>, I acquired this domain and got started with WordPress hosting — a moment of great pride for me!

Over time, social media took centre stage, and while the site remained, it became mostly inactive. I once thought of using this domain as a design portfolio, but it never quite worked out. In 2020, I faced a crucial decision: either revitalise this project or let it go. That's when I discovered the concept of a digital garden, inspired by <a href="https://docs.thottingal.in/">Santosh Thottingal's Docs</a> and <a href="https://wiki.nikiv.dev/">Nikita Voloboev's Wiki.</a> This led me to the current version (version 16?) of Hiran.in!

This website is a reflection of my ongoing ideas and work, following a workflow that suits me best. The homepage design draws inspiration from <a href="https://paco.me/">Paco's website</a>, while the collections are based on <a href="https://matthewstrom.com/reading">Matthw Ström's</a> reading list. The Async design coaching is inspired by <a href="https://anthonyhobday.com/">Anthony Hobday</a>, and the Now page is based on <a href="https://sive.rs/">Derek Sivers's</a> <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Now Page</a>.

Built with <a href="https://wiki.nikiv.dev/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>, I used <a href="https://github.com/raghudotcc/simply-jekyll">Simply Jekyll</a> as a starting point for this version, which I now maintain under the theme <a href="https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io">Jekyll Garden</a>. For code highlighting, I rely on <a href="https://github.com/jwarby/jekyll-pygments-themes">Highlight.css</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> serves as the Content Management System for this site. 

Notably, this website stands out from other product designer websites, as it boldly uses 98% <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter">Inter</a> and 2% <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Newsreader">Newsreader</a> as the typeface — quite the unique choice!🤣.
